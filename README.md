### Project Description
[Our project is a dictionary where every time someone asks for the meaning of a word, they get the opposite of its true meaning. This could lead to humorous and nonsensical interpretations.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[HThis project could be a great way to combine humor and language while creating something entertaining for others!]
